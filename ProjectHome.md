Implements a unified approach to Mahalanobis metric learning: an online regularized metric learning algorithm based on the ideas of composite objective mirror descent (COMID). This approach aims to be scalable, kernelizable, and admissible to many different types of Bregman and loss functions, which allows for the tailoring of several different classes of algorithms. Trace-norm regularization allows the learning of a low-rank metric, and the solution performing feature selection along with metric learning.
